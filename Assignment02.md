# 1. Executive Summary


# 2. Introduction 

- Cloud computing has become the main way companies build and run modern applications. Instead of buying their own hardware, organizations use cloud providers to host APIs, process data, and support real-time features like chat, live dashboards, and event streaming. This report focuses on three major cloud service providers (CSPs): Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
- AWS is Amazon’s public cloud platform that offers more than 200 services across compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, and many other areas. It is widely used for building web applications, APIs, and large-scale data platforms using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. 
- Microsoft Azure is Microsoft’s cloud platform for building, deploying, and managing applications across cloud, hybrid, and edge environments. It provides a broad range of services including compute, storage, networking, analytics, and AI, and it integrates tightly with other Microsoft tools such as Windows Server, Active Directory, and Office 365.
- Google Cloud Platform is Google’s suite of cloud services that runs on the same global infrastructure as products like Google Search and Gmail. It offers infrastructure, platform, and serverless services with a strong focus on data analytics and machine learning through tools like BigQuery and Dataflow. 
- In this report, we compare AWS, Azure, and GCP for remote data and real-time applications. The main focus is on RESTful APIs, GraphQL, WebSockets, data streaming, and stream analytics. The goal is to understand how each provider supports these workloads and to identify which platform may be a better fit for different real-world use cases.
